# Guesser
A game where the computer randomly generates numbers until it matches the user-appointed target within the user-appointed range. 
It will print how many attempts were generated and a percentage that represents the chance that the guess had to be the target.

This branch holds the code that the website is made from. https://bmacke12.github.io/Guesser/
